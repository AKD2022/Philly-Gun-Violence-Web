        <h1>Statistics - Numbers</h1>
        <p>
            While looking at gun violence in Philadelphia, there are a lot of categories that we could look at. However, 
            I decided to chose Age, Race, and Fatalities. As you scroll down the page, I have provided pie charts with 
            in depth data of Age and Race, and then I compared the two on a line chart. After that I have provided another
            line chart that compares the amount of unfatal incidents with fatal incidents. <i>Note: All <a href="https://controller.phila.gov/philadelphia-audits/mapping-gun-violence/#/?year=2024&map=11.00%2F39.98500%2F-75.15000">data</a> is from 2023</i>

                <p>
                Data shows that the highest amount of age to get affected by gun violence is people from Ages 18-30, totalling 743. 
                From there, a close second is people from 31-45, which total to 534. People older than 45 are also affected, and that 
                totals to 202. People younger than 18, are one of the least affected by gun violence, totaling 163, and following that
                unkown ages make up a total of 23.

                Data shows that the highest amount of race to get affect by gun violence is people who are Black (Non-Hisapnic), totalling 1289.
                From there, there is a significant decrease to the second highest category, Hispanic (Black & White), which had a total of 245. 
                From there the next highest category are White (Non-Hispanic), which had a total of 109. The last two categories, Asian and 
                Other/Unknown had a total of 23 incidents.

                This chart compares the amount of age and race/ethniity gun violence cases. From this chart, 
                we can see that both lines peak at the 18-30 category, and Black (Non-Hispanic), just like we learned 
                in the previous data. I just wanted to include this to show how they compare with one another, 
                and show you how each line varies from one another.

                This chart compares the amount of fatal and unfatal gun violence incidents in Philadlephia. From this,
                we are able to see that the amount of fatal cases has been significantly lower than the amount of unfatal 
                cases since 2015. It is also visible that both fatal and unfatal cases have recently increased drastically
                but is starting to trend down a little.
