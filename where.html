      <h1>Learn Where</h1>
      <p>Now that you know the numbers, we need to continue. Learning about Gun Violence and then being able 
        to prevent it, isn't helpful without knowing where it happens the most. Instead of looking at Philadelphia 
        as a whole, its better to look at it seperately. In these next few sections, you will deep dive into the 
        three most populated sections of Philadelphia, be able to look at a map, and be able to learn where gun violence
        happens the most.

       <p>In these next few sections, you will learn about the amounts of gun violence in North Philly, South Philly, 
        and West Philly. These are areas where gun violence are most prominent, and have the densest population. In 
        each section, you will be able to interact with a map, which have circles to indicate high to low areas of gun 
        gun violence, but since it is so hard to get exact data points, these will be estimated. In each section, there
        is also a short summary explaining what the map shows and what we can learn from the datapoints given on the map. 
        <br>All data comes from: <a href="https://controller.phila.gov/philadelphia-audits/mapping-gun-violence/#/?year=2024&map=11.00%2F39.98500%2F-75.15000">Here</a>

          (the left of the map), there are hardly any incidents, and only and max-estimate of 5 incidents.

        South Philly in total is not a big area. Most of the gun violence is spread out so its hard to place more than one circle
        on the map. South Philly in general is a "high violence" area based on the categories that I created, but it's max-estimate 
        is 130, nowhere near as high as North Philly.

        West Philly has a lot of variation in its gun violence incidents. In the top right corner,
        we see an increase of cases, and when we go all the way west, (to the left of the map), this is
        where west philly contains most of its incidents. It does have one green area, though, its very 
        small, and we want it to be the whole area, rather than just one tiny bit.

      <h1>Prevention</h1>

        Now that we know, the detailed statistics, numbers and location, its time to move to prevention. There's
        no way that gun violence will stop, unless we take action, and the best way to start, is to learn how 
        it's caused, and then how to prevent it.
