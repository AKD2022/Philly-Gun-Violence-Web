              <h1>Cause #1: Poverty & Economic Inequality</h1>
              <p>Poverty is a big cause of gun violence. Almost 25% of people in Philadelphia live in poverty, leading to
                hopelessness and desperation. Poverty often restricts individuals access to employment. This creates
                an open area for high stress and this could lead to desperation. Poverty also means a lack of resources
                and affordable healthcare. Without these resources, people could feel marginalized or disconnected
                from the rest of society, leading to social unrest and/or illegal activites.

              Preventing poverty in Philadelphia requires more than one solution. Investing in education 
              and training for work can help people get jobs and reduce the unemployment rate. Another way 
              to prevent poverty is by implementing policies that promote affordable housing and healthcare
              access can alleviate financial burdens on low-income families. Furthermore, supporting small 
              businesses and promoting economic development in underserved communities can create job opportunities
              and help stimulate local economies. Finally, there are already many foundations that are trying
              to help reduce poverty rates in Philly like:</p>

              Preventing gang violence and drug trafficking in Philadelphia necessitates targeted strategies. 
              Investing in education and vocational training provides alternatives to illicit activities. 
              Strengthening community policing fosters trust and disrupts gang operations. Implementing economic

            <p>
              Easy access to firearms in Philadelphia contributes significantly to the city's gun violence problem. 
              Despite strict gun control laws, illegal firearms flow into the city through various channels, including
              straw purchases, theft, and trafficking from neighboring states with lenient regulations. The rapid increase
              of the number of guns increases the likelihood of violence and escalates conflicts, making the challenges 
              faced by communities already grappling with socioeconomic disparities and other systemic issues even worse.

            <p>Preventing the ease of access to firearms in Philadelphia needs more than one solution. Strengthening
              background checks and licensing requirements can prevent illegal ownership of deadly firearms. Enhanced 
              enforcement against illegal gun trafficking and unlicensed dealers is crucial. Implementing community buyback
              programs and promoting safe storage practices can reduce the availability of firearms. Additionally, public 
              awareness campaigns on responsible gun ownership and advocacy for stricter federal regulations contribute to 
              mitigating the flow of firearms into the city.</p>
